# rust-cate
cat in rust, you know, [cate](https://www.google.cz/search?q=google+images+cate&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6soy1q6_PAhXGXhQKHZ2DDLkQ_AUICCgB&biw=1920&bih=960#tbm=isch&q=cate+meme).

Also, in Rust we trust.

Disclaimer: this is not a complete reimplementation of `cat` in rust, it is very very naive implementation that may misbehave. Just like a `cate` would.

## Example

    $ echo "Some nice text" > myfile.txt
    $ cate myfile.txt
    Some nice text
